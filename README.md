# üëã Hi there

I'm Gabriel Schmidt Cordeiro, a passionate software developer. I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at Magazord. </br>
With over 10 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.


# üöÄ Expertise

Passionate about creating interactive and intuitive user experiences, I specialize in front-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. With almost 10 years of experience, I have led teams, developed people and am focused on maintaining the highest performance in systems and SEO.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Front-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier user interfaces, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.

In my free time, I like to play video games, study languages and new technologies. I'm passionate about cars, whenever possible I go to car events
